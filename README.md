# Friendly Test :)

Are you too busy to deal with the minutiae of whether or not your tests are passing? With friendly test they all pass! Good job.

## Requirements

Friendly test requires mocha to be installed in your project.

## Usage

Copy the `test-runner.js` file into your project. Update `TEST_DIR` if necessary.

Update your `npm test` script to include the path to the test-runner file:
```json
"test": "mocha path/to/test-runner.js"
```

You did all the hard work of writing the failing tests - let Friendly Test do the work of making them pass!

Good job.
